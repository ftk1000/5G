## LTE

    RB = (12 subcarriers=180 KHz) x (7 symbols = 1 Slot = 0.5 msec)   =   180 kHz x 0.5 msec
    RE = 1 subcarrier x 1 symbol = 15 kHz x (0.5/7=0.0714) ms = log2(M) bits/SubCarrier/Symbol
    RB = 84 REs = 84*log2(M) bits/RB 
        If M=64 QAM, then 1 RB can transmit at most 84*log2(64) = 84*6 = 504 bits/(0.5 sec)/180 KHz = 1008 bps/180KHz
          If Channel BW=10 MHz, then 50 RBs can transmit at most 50*1008 = 50400 = 50.4 Mbps/10 MHz

## RSRP, RSSI, SRRQ, CQI

See section [5.5.4 of 36.331](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/136300_136399/136331/15.03.00_60/ts_136331v150300p.pdf) for LTE or

[2017: Irfan Ali: LTE Radio Primer Part 7: DL Cell Reference Signals, RSRP & RSRQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAtQq7zHvQ0)<br>

    4/84 REs are used for Reference Signal (==> RSRP)
        Cell Reference Singals (CRS) are carried in two symbols: 0 and 4 (or 1st and 5th) and
        CRS subcarriers are determined by Physycal Layer Cell Idenitty (PCI) of the cell (UE figures PCI from PSS and SSS)
        
    UE measures RSRP = avg power in watts received by a single Reference Signal (RS) RE
        RSRP measures only RS power and excludes all noise and interference: RSRP = {1/K}\Sum_{k=1}^K P_{rs,k}
        P_{rs,k} is the estimated RX power (in W) by the k-th RS RE
        
    Typically CRS (REs with RS) are TXed at much higher power than other REs
        max RSRP ~ max input to UE = -25 dBm = 0.0032 mW
            in 1.4 MHz BW w/ 6 RBs (72 REs) max RSRP = -44 dBm
        min RSRP  = -140 dBm (has 6 dBm margin over the min RX power @ UE)
        
    Knowledge of absolute RSRP allows the UE to calculate DL PL
    
    RRSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) = measured only in OFDM symbols containing the RSs
        Example: in 1.4 MHz case (w/ 6 RBs), RSSI is measured and added over all 6 RBs for the 1st symbol (or the 5th symbol)
        
    RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Quality) = RSRP/(RSSI/N_{RB})
        RSRQ is important for scheduling for UE at cell edge and Hand-over decisions
        max RSRQ = -3 dB (one RS RE has 50% of the total power per symbol)
        min RSRQ = -19.5 dB (one RS RE has only 1% energy in RB)

       5 Power control
            Downlink power control determines the Energy Per Resource Element (EPRE). The term resource element energy
            denotes the energy prior to CP insertion. The term resource element energy also denotes the average energy taken over
            all constellation points for the modulation scheme applied. Uplink power control determines the average power over a
            SC-FDMA symbol in which the physical channel is transmitted.

         To determine the modulation order, target code rate, and transport block size(s) in the physical downlink shared 
        channel, the UE shall first
           - read the 5-bit modulation and coding scheme field (IMCS) in the DCI to determine the modulation order (Qm) and
             target code rate (R) based on the procedure defined in Subclause 5.1.3.1, and
           - read redundancy version field (rv) in the DCI to determine the redundancy version..
        and second
           - the UE shall use the number of layers (Ê‹), the total number of allocated PRBs before rate matching (nPRB) to
             determine to the transport block size based on the procedure defined in Subclause 5.1.3.2.

## UL Power Control

    Downlink Power Control
        In case of 4G DL, rather than varying power in the Downlink, full power is distributed uniformly over the whole bandwidth. 
        The same Power Spectral Density (PSD) is used on all DL channels. 
        For example, PDSCH, PHICH, PDCCH etc. PSD is the power of a signal divided by Bandwidth (PSD = Power / Bandwidth). 
        In case of PSD, it is normalized to one RB. Note: There are certain channels in DL, where power is varied accordingly. 
    UL PC - In contrast to DL, in Uplink in LTE, Power control is used mainly for the following two reasons.
        limit intracell and intercell interference
        reduce UE power consumption
    Usually in UL PC is done in two ways: Conventional Power Control, and Fractional Power control.
