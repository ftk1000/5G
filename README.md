# Subscriber Identification

* [IMSI: International mobile subscriber identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity)<br>

     A unique identifier of every user of a cellular network. It is stored as a 64-bit field and is sent by the mobile device 
     to the network. It is also used for acquiring other details of the mobile in the home location register (HLR) or as locally 
     copied in the visitor LR. To prevent eavesdroppers from identifying and tracking the subscriber on the radio interface, 
     the IMSI is sent as rarely as possible and a randomly-generated TMSI is sent instead.

* [E.212 : The international identification plan for public networks and subscriptions](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.212-201609-I/en)<br>

     IMSI Format: Maximium 15 digits divided by: MCC (3 digist) + MNC (2-3 digits) + MSIN (<=10 digits), eg 
     
          * MCC :  Mobile Country Code
          * MNC :  Mpbile Network Code
          * MSIN : Mobile Subsciption Identification Number

# Equipment Identification

* [IMEI: International Mobile Equipment Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity)<br>

    A number, usually unique, to identify 3GPP and iDEN mobile phones, as well as some satellite phones. It is usually found printed 
    inside the battery compartment of the phone, but can also be displayed on-screen on most phones by entering * #06# MMI Supplementary 
    Service code on the dialpad, or alongside other system information in the settings menu on smartphone operating systems.

* [SIM Card, ICCID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card#ICCID)<br>

    [ICCID](https://www.emnify.com/resources/iccid-number) stands for Integrated Circuit Card Identification Number. 
    It’s a unique 18-22 digit code that includes a SIM card’s country, home network, and identification number. 
    You’ll usually find an ICCID printed on the back of a SIM card, but sometimes it’s included in the packaging materials instead.
    
* [SEID and NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication)<br>

     * Near-Field-Communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols for communication between two electronic devices over a 
     distance of 4 cm or less. NFC offers a low-speed connection with simple setup that can be used to bootstrap more-capable wireless connections.
     * The Secure Element chip, an NFC chip that contains data such as the Secure Element Identifier (SEID) for secure transactions. 
     This chip is commonly found in smartphones and other NFC devices.
