* [IMSI: International mobile subscriber identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity)<br>

     A unique identifier of every user of a cellular network. It is stored as a 64-bit field and is sent by the mobile device to the network. 
     It is also used for acquiring other details of the mobile in the home location register (HLR) or as locally copied in the visitor LR. 
     To prevent eavesdroppers from identifying and tracking the subscriber on the radio interface, the IMSI is sent as rarely as possible 
     and a randomly-generated TMSI is sent instead.
     
* [IMEI: International Mobile Equipment Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity)<br>

    A number, usually unique, to identify 3GPP and iDEN mobile phones, as well as some satellite phones. It is usually found printed 
    inside the battery compartment of the phone, but can also be displayed on-screen on most phones by entering * #06# MMI Supplementary 
    Service code on the dialpad, or alongside other system information in the settings menu on smartphone operating systems.
